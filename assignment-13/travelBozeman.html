<p>
  Downtown Bozeman has loads of historic buildings that have been renovated into restaurants and hotels. It allows the town to have that same classic feeling while catering to the high end clientel that has been moving there. Although it's sad to see for locals like myself that is just the way things have been going there. I do still really enjoy going home though because of the landscape and the small bit of character that the town still has to offer.

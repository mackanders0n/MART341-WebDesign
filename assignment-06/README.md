Difference between structural and semantic markup.

Structural markup is the information components within an HTML. This could be headings, lists or paragraphs. Some HTML elements are strictly structural but they essentially encode information about what you want to implement in your html. Semantic markup is more about the meaning of content in an HTML rather than just displaying it or getting it on the page. It can change fonts or add symbols that give the viewer a better experience.

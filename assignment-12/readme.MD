The difference between padding, margin, and borders is the use for each of them. Padding is typically used around paragraphs or pictures to give a more aesthetic appeal. Margins are the space between paragraphs or between words and the edge of the page. A border is similar to padding in the fact that it is used to help with the aesthetic of the page.
